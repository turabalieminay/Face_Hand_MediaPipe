# MediaPipe Face Mesh and Hand Detection

This repository contains projects demonstrating how to use MediaPipe's Face Mesh and Hand solutions for real-time facial and hand landmarks detection. MediaPipe provides powerful and efficient solutions for face and hand tracking, which can be integrated into various applications such as AR, gesture recognition, and more.

## Project Overview

In these projects, I utilized MediaPipeâ€™s **Face Mesh** and **Hand Detection** solutions to detect key facial and hand landmarks in real-time using a webcam or video file. These models provide accurate landmark tracking and can be used for applications like facial analysis, hand gesture recognition, and augmented reality.

### MediaPipe Face Mesh

The **Face Mesh** solution detects and tracks 468 facial landmarks in real-time. It is highly efficient and can be used for applications like face filters, facial expression recognition, and more. The model uses a lightweight approach, making it suitable for mobile and web applications.

### MediaPipe Hand Detection

The **Hand Detection** solution detects hands and tracks 21 keypoints for each hand. This solution is particularly useful for gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and hand-based interactions in virtual environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Mesh Detection**:
  - Detects 468 facial landmarks using MediaPipe Face Mesh.
  - Provides high accuracy and low-latency landmark tracking.
  
- **Real-time Hand Detection**:
  - Detects and tracks hands with 21 key landmarks per hand.
  - Supports multiple hand detection for gesture recognition.

- **Real-time Video Processing**:
  - Both solutions work in real-time, utilizing webcam input or pre-recorded videos.

## How It Works

1. **Face Mesh Detection**:
   - The Face Mesh model detects 468 landmarks on the face and tracks them frame by frame.
   - It can be used for tasks like facial landmark detection, face alignment, or even AR applications.

2. **Hand Detection**:
   - The Hand Detection model tracks 21 keypoints on each hand, allowing for detailed gesture analysis and interaction in real-time.

3. **Real-time Processing**:
   - Both solutions use the webcam for real-time landmark detection and tracking.
   - The solutions are optimized for performance, providing smooth and efficient results even on lower-end devices.
